# Juake

A Quake clone written by me, Jake Stanley, hence the name.

This readme has been written with the target platform being Linux, but I may add stuff for bootstrapping Windows and macOS environments later.

## Linux development environment setup

```
sudo pacman -S base-devel
sudo pacman -S freeglut
```
